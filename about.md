My name is Trent McClenahan and I'm passionate about the web and establishing high performing software delivery teams.

Most of my IT career has been in Sydney, but in 2012 my family and I made the change up to the amazing [Newcastle, Australia](http://www.visitnewcastle.com.au/) (see change&trade;).
